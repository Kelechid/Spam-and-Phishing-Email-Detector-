# Spam-and-Phishing-Email-Detector-
A machine learning model for detecting spam and phishing email that is ready to be deployed

📧 Spam Email Classifier using Deep Learning
A deep learning project that detects spam emails using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a neural network built with Keras. The model was trained on a labeled email dataset, preprocessed with standard NLP steps, vectorized using TF-IDF, and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🔍 Project Objective
To develop and evaluate a deep learning model that can distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails based on the email content. The model is trained on a pre-labeled dataset and can also be used to classify new emails by copying their content into the system.

📁 Dataset Description
Source: Pre-labeled spam/ham email datasets (combined from multiple sources).

Total Samples: ~11,300 emails

Split:

Training set: 70%

Validation set: 10%

Test set: 20%

🧹 Preprocessing Steps
Text data was cleaned using the following steps:

Lowercasing all text

Removing HTML tags, URLs, line breaks, numbers, and punctuation

Tokenizing text and removing stopwords

Applying stemming using NLTK’s PorterStemmer

Example preprocessing code:

python
Copy
Edit
text = re.sub(r'<.*?>', '', text)                 # Remove HTML tags
text = re.sub(r'\n+', ' ', text)                  # Remove line breaks
text = re.sub(r'https?://\S+', '', text)          # Remove URLs
text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)                   # Remove numbers
text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
🧠 Model Architecture
A simple feedforward neural network (DNN) implemented using Keras:

python
Copy
Edit
model = Sequential([
    Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(5000,)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
Input: 5000-dimensional TF-IDF vector

Output: Binary classification (1 = spam, 0 = ham)

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Epochs: 10

Batch Size: 32

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Keras & TensorFlow

Numpy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

NLTK (for NLP)

Matplotlib (for optional training plots)

🚀 Practical Usage
You can test the model by copying the content of an email (e.g., from Gmail’s spam folder) and running it through the same preprocessing and prediction steps used during training. Here’s an example:

python
Copy
Edit
sample_text = """Congratulations! You've won a free iPhone. Click here to claim your prize: http://scam-url.com"""

# Apply preprocessing (same as training)
# Vectorize using fitted TF-IDF vectorizer
# Predict using trained model

sample_vector = vectorizer.transform([preprocess(sample_text)]).toarray()
prediction = model.predict(sample_vector)
print("Spam" if prediction[0][0] > 0.5 else "Ham")
📦 Future Work
Integrate with Gmail API to classify real-time inbox/spam content.

Develop a web or Node-RED based interface for non-technical use.

Train with more diverse datasets for greater generalization.
